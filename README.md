# Numbersystem

### Here I have solved three questions:
### 1. A JavaScript code that prints even and odd numbers from the given random array:
### const numbers = [
  3, 7, 2, 15, 9, 20, 5, 14, 12, 1, 8, 11, 6, 19, 4, 10, 17, 13, 16, 18,
];
## Expected output is: Even : 3 7 15 9 5 1 11 19 17 13 
Odd : 2 20 14 12 8 6 4 10 16 18 

### 2. A JavaScript code that finds all the prime numbers from the given array:
### const numbers = [
  19, 23, 4, 16, 28, 13, 31, 8, 29, 14, 6, 35, 2, 11, 17, 5, 9, 27, 12, 30,
];
## Expected output is: Prime numbers [
  19, 23, 13, 31, 29,
   2, 11, 17,  5 ] Minimum: 2 Maximum: 31 SUm: 150
